Background: CA-breast is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women with 15% prevalence. CA-breast lymphedema is most common complication of mastectomy. Treatment options available for lymphedema is currently limited to application of massage, active exercises and faradism under pressure. As alone faradism under pressure was found to be effective in treating ca-breast lymphedema but as there is limited research available to show any significant impact of biofeedback exercises with simultaneous application of faradism under pressure on lymphedema. , so this made indeed to study the effect of faradism under pressure with biofeedback exercises in ca-breast lymphedema. Aim(s): Effect of faradism under pressure with biofeedback exercises in Ca-breast lymphedema. Study design: The study design was Pre test-Post test single blinded study. Method(s): A total 30 women were allocated into 3 groups using convenient sampling technique. Group (A) received Faradism under pressure with simultaneous biofeedback exercises, group (B) received Faradism under pressure without biofeedback exercises and group (C) received only Faradism under pressure. Each group received treatment for 3days/week for 4 weeks. Pre and post treatment assessment was taken using VAS, Limb girth, volumetric assessment and Goniometry (shoulder, elbow and wrist) as outcome measures. Statistical Analysis: Data was analyzed using Paired't' test and ANOVA-repeated measure. Result(s): In this study group (A) showed better effect on outcome than group (B) and (C). volumetric assessment P value was 0.4409 which was not significant. On other outcome measure VAS, Limb girth and goniometry was extremely significant. Thus this study shows extremely significant improvement in group (A) treated with Faradism under pressure with simultaneous biofeedback exercises. Conclusion(s): Faradism under pressure with simultaneous biofeedback exercises are effective in treating CA-breast lymphedema which improves subjects functional as well as personal outcome in daily life than conventional treatment alone.

Introduction. The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of two individualized physical interventions on the upper limb condition after radical mastectomy. Methods. Overall, 68 patients after breast cancer surgery participated in 12-week outpatient rehabilitation. They were randomly enrolled for water individualized physical intervention (water exercise group, n = 34) and Pilates physical intervention (Pilates group, n = 34). Upper limb force (dynamometry), size of upper limb lymphedema (circumference), and active range of motion (goniometry) on the affected side were determined before and after 36 individualized physical rehabilitation sessions. Results. After 12-week physical rehabilitation, the average values of active range of flexion and abduction were statistically significantly higher in the water exercise group compared with the Pilates group by 8.73 degrees (p < 0.01) and 6.87 degrees (p < 0.01), respectively. The size of lymphedema in the area of forearm and hand was significantly lower in the water exercise group compared with the Pilates group by 0.46 cm (p < 0.05) and 0.44 cm (p < 0.05), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in upper limb force between the studied groups at the end of the 12-week intervention. Conclusions. The results have confirmed that elaborated individualized physical interventions might be considered as effective methods for range of motion improvement and decrease in breast cancer-related lymphedema in patients with post-mastectomy syndrome. The 3-month water exercises were more effective in improving mobility and muscle force of the upper limb and decreasing lymphedema than Pilates exercises.
OBJECTIVE: This study of pressure monitoring of multilayer inelastic bandaging and the effect of padding in breast cancer-related lymphedema patients aimed to measure the resting and working sub-bandage pressures in compression therapy for lymphedema patients and to determine whether applying additional padding has an additional effect in volume reduction of the limb.DESIGN: Forty-eight patients with breast cancer who were beginning complex decongestive therapy for lymphedema were included. In 24 patients, padding was added to the forearm. A short-stretch bandage with or without padding was applied to the affected arm. The working pressure was measured while the patients squeezed a rubber device. The forearm limb circumference was measured before and after 2 wks of treatment.RESULTS: The mean (SD) of the resting pressure was 36.3 (2.2) mm Hg without padding and 49.5 (3.2) mm Hg with padding. The mean (SD) of the working pressure was 9.5 (3.7) mm Hg without padding and 24.3 (9.1) mm Hg with padding (P < 0.05). The volume loss after treatment was significantly greater in the group with added padding (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The working pressure during exercising with a force of 50 Pa is approximately 10 mm Hg with a short-stretch bandage applied. Adding a pad increases both the resting and the working pressure and also seems to be effective in increasing volume reduction of the limb.
[Purpose] Post mastectomy lymphedema is common among breast cancer survivors. It leads to physical discomfort and functional impairment. Rehabilitation forms the mainstay of treatment and is multidisciplinary. [Subjects and Methods] Sixty post mastectomy patients were allocated randomly and assigned to either a conventional treatment group (n=30) or a complete decongestive therapy (CDT) group (n=30). The conventional treatment group received manual lymphatic drainage, wore a low elastic compression garment, received glenohumeral mobilization, and performed deep breathing exercises, and the complete decongestive therapy group received CDT from a trained physiotherapist and a daily home program along with the conventional treatment, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. [Results] Arm circumference measurements were taken at five levels: the wrist, mid forearm, elbow, mid-upper arm, and axilla. The upper extremity function was evaluated using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, and pain was assessed using the visual analogue scale. Measurements were taken at baseline, and at 4th and 6th weeks after the start of intervention. Within and between group comparisons showed significant improvements in the CDT group. [Conclusion] Complete decongestive therapy and a home program assists breast cancer related lymphedema survivors in regaining their lost functions. It also helps to improve their independence in daily activities, reduce their need for caregivers, and thereby improving their quality of life. Therefore, the results of this study showed that the CDT with a home program is an effective treatment for reducing post mastectomy lymphedema.
Background: To describe a novel 'Batman' scrotectomy technique and present our single centre experience in the management of secondary scrotal lymphoedema in penile cancer patients.Methods: A retrospective review of the medical records of penile cancer patients with extensive and bothersome penoscrotal lymphoedema failing conservative therapy between 2013 and 2018. We analysed patients' demographics, pre-operative disease stage, post-operative outcomes and complications.Results: Seven patients with a history of penile cancer and problematic scrotal lymphoedema were managed using a novel 'Batman' scrotectomy technique. The mean age was 56.4 (range, 28-71) years. The mean inpatient stay was 4.1 (range, 2-7) days. Two patients (28.6%) were found to have incidental metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the scrotal skin on histological analysis. One patient developed superficial wound dehiscence (Clavien-Dindo grade II) and two patients had mild post-operative residual penile lymphoedema. Following a mean follow-up period of 19 months, 2 patients died due to metastatic penile cancer. One patient developed skin metastases in his thigh and perineum. All of the patients reported a good cosmetic and functional outcome on post-operative review.Conclusions: Genital lymphoedema is an uncommon side-effect of penile cancer treatment. In severe cases where patients fail conservative treatments, surgical intervention using this technique is effective and feasible.
PURPOSE: Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a debilitating condition. The recommended treatment is based on decongestive lymphedema therapy (DLT) with two separate phases: a short-term intensive phase to reduce lymphedema volume and a long-term maintenance phase to stabilize it. Optimizing compression therapy and compliance during maintenance phase are key factors for long-term control of lymphedema. The primary objective of this pilot prospective open-label randomized study was to assess the benefit of a new auto-adjustable nighttime arm sleeve (MOBIDERM R Autofit) on lymphedema volume during the maintenance phase after the intensive phase.METHODS: Forty women with BRCL were consecutively enrolled and randomized (D0) for 1 month in 1:1 ratio either in night-use group: with MOBIDERM R Autofit (on top of a daytime compression hosiery), or in no night-use group: without MOBIDERM R Autofit (daytime hosiery alone). From Day 31 to Day 90, all patients were fitted with MOBIDERM R Autofit. Primary endpoint was lymphedema volume variation between Day 0 and Day 30. Secondary endpoints were compliance, quality of life (LYMQOL arm questionnaire), functional symptoms (heaviness, limb use limitation, pain), sleep quality, and safety.RESULTS: In ITT population, between Day 0 and Day 30, mean lymphedema volume increase was higher in no night-use group with 92.9 mL (i.e., 3.2%) than in night-use group with 46.7 mL (i.e., 1.80%), p = 0.757. Between Day 30 and Day 90, all patients fitted with MOBIDERM R Autofit, lymphedema volume remained stable in both groups. The device improved functional symptoms and function domain of the LYMQOL arm questionnaire. MOBIDERM R Autofit was worn overnight almost 85% of the nights. It was well accepted by the patients and no adverse reaction leading to permanent device discontinuation occurred.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that MOBIDERM R Autofit offers clinical benefits during maintenance phase of lymphedema treatment and enhances patient's self-management.
There is no cure for breast cancer related lymphedema. This study was conducted to compare two treatment methods for postmastectomy lymphedema: Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT) and Modified CDT (MCDT) combined with Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC). One hundred and twelve patients referred to the Lymphedema Clinic of the Iranian Center for Breast Cancer in 2008, were included in a randomized clinical trial. They were randomly allocated into two equal groups receiving daily CDT alone or in combination with IPC. The volume reduction of the upper limb was measured by water displacement volumetry. No statistically significant differences in demographic and clinical variables between the two groups were observed. During the intensive phase (phase I) of treatment, CDT alone yielded a significantly higher mean volume reduction than the combination modality (43.1% vs. 37.5%; p = 0.036). Limb volume measured three months following treatment, showed 16.9% volume reduction by CDT alone, and 7.5% reduction by MCDT plus IPC. This study demonstrated that the use of CDT alone, or in combination with IPC significantly reduced limb volume in patients with post mastectomy lymphedema. CDT alone provided better results in both treatment phases. Further studies will help to define the role of multidisciplinary approaches in the management of postmastectomy lymphedema.
BACKGROUND: Lymphedema is a common, progressive, and often debilitating condition that can occur after breast cancer treatment. Preliminary reports on vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) have been promising. We propose an algorithmic approach to simultaneous VLNT with microvascular breast reconstruction (MBR) and provide early results.METHODS: All patients who underwent simultaneous VLNT with MBR were included. Postoperative evaluation was performed at standardized time points and included qualitative assessment and quantitative volumetric analysis.RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2013, 29 consecutive patients with refractory lymphedema secondary to breast cancer treatment underwent simultaneous VLNT with MBR. Mean follow-up was 11 months. On average, patients had experienced 3.3 years of lymphedema symptoms with 21 % increased volume in the affected arm compared with the unaffected arm. Using our algorithmic approach, all patients underwent successful breast reconstruction. There were no flap losses, and no patients developed donor site lymphedema. Six patients (21 %) experienced donor site wound complications that resolved with conservative measures; 23 patients (79 %) reported sustained symptomatic improvement after reconstruction. The mean volume differential volumes improved to 20, 19, 14, and 10 % at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after reconstruction, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm provides a reliable approach to optimizing simultaneous abdominal free flap breast reconstruction and VLNT and demonstrates promising results. Long-term studies are warranted to further delineate and improve the safety and efficacy of lymph node transfers.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differences between the effects of complex decongestive physiotherapy with and without active resistive exercise for the treatment of patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL).DESIGN: Randomized control-group study.SETTING: An outpatient rehabilitation clinic.PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=40) with diagnosed BCRL.INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to either the active resistive exercise group or the nonactive resistive exercise group. In the active resistive exercise group, after complex decongestive physiotherapy, active resistive exercise was performed for 15min/d, 5 days a week for 8 weeks. The nonactive resistive exercise group performed only complex decongestive physiotherapy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The circumferences of the upper limbs (proximal, distal, and total) for the volume changes, and the Short Form-36 version 2 questionnaire for the quality of life (QOL) at pretreatment and 8 weeks posttreatment for each patient.RESULTS: The volume of the proximal part of the arm was significantly more reduced in the active resistive exercise group than that of the nonactive resistive exercise group (P<.05). In the active resistive exercise group, there was significantly more improvement in physical health and general health, as compared with that of the nonactive resistive exercise group (P<.05).CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of patients with BCRL, active resistive exercise with complex decongestive physiotherapy did not cause additional swelling, and it significantly reduced proximal arm volume and helped improve QOL.
INTRODUCTION: Lymphedema resulting from breast cancer treatment is a chronic condition that can significantly compromise quality of life. Several works have documented the efficacy of vascularized lymph node flap transfer (VLNT) for the treatment of advanced-stage lymphedema. Given that the axillary scar may contribute to the patient's existing lymphedema, the authors assumed that combining VLNT and scar release with fat graft could be an effective strategy of treatment. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy in the reduction of limb circumference and health-related quality of life between a combined strategy, namely, VLN transfer (VLNT) and axillary scar release with fat grafting, and only VLNT for patients affected by postmastectomy upper limb lymphedema. The idea.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with stage II and III breast cancer-related lymphedema operated between January 2012 and January 2016 were retrospectively identified, and only those treated by combined VLNT and scar release (Group A) or only VLNT (Group B) were included. The outcomes were assessed clinically by limb circumference measurement and radiologically by lymphoscintigraphy. Lymphedema-related quality of life was evaluated preoperatively and at 1 year follow-up through the LYMQOL questionnaire.RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria (Group A=18; Group B=21). Mean follow-up was 29 months for Group A and 32 months for Group B. Flap survival rate was 100%, with no donor site morbidity in all patients. A statistically significant difference between the circumference reduction rates (RR) at above elbow level was observed at 3 and 6 months of follow-up comparing the two groups (p<0.00001), with higher values in Group A than in Group B. No significant difference was detected comparing RR values at above and below elbow at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. LYMQOL metrics showed significantly better scores (p<0.0001) in all domains at all follow-up appointments in Group A.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with postmastectomy upper limb lymphedema can benefit from combined lymph node transfer and axillary scar release with fat graft, as this approach seems to fasten the onset of improvement and to have a positive impact on patients' quality of life.
BACKGROUND: This study was designed to introduce the key points about the transplantation of lower abdominal flap with vascularized lymph node and to evaluate the effect of breast restoration, breast reconstruction, and lymphatic transplantation to treat upper limb lymphedema after breast cancer surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was based on the retrospective study on 10 cases of postmastectomy lymphedema during January 2008 to March 2011. All patients, aged 36 to 50 years, have had one-side upper-limb lymphedema for 3 to 5 years. Six patients had accepted radiotherapy. Four patients had a diagnosis of severe lymphedema, and 2 patients had moderate lymphedema. The isotope radiography before the operation showed obstruction of lymphatic return, and the multidetector computed tomography that followed delivered a clear picture of the abdominal flap blood supply and the blood vessels in the breasts. During the operation, the scar contracture of the axilla was completely relaxed, and all patients accepted abdominal transplantation of lower abdominal flap with vascularized lymph node. After the operation, the elastic bandages were applied for one year as an adjuvant therapy. The follow-up visits were conducted 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the surgery. The measurement indexes included mid-upper arm circumference, clinical symptoms, and lymphoscintigraphy. RESULTS: All flaps worked well. One patient was found to have delayed wound healing; one patient saw no obvious improvement in lymphedema; 7 patients with lymphedema were relieved with apparent improvement in the affected limbs' mean perimeter and clinical symptoms; one patient recovered; and another patient was lost to follow-up. The mean reduction was 2.122+/-2.331 cm, and the reduction of the lymphedematous limb was statistically significant between the preoperative and 12-month postoperative groups (P<0.05). The results were good in 4 patients and excellent in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The transplantation of abdominal flap with vascularized lymph node and breast reconstruction, accompanied by the treatment to upper limb lymphedema and using elastic bandages as an adjuvant therapy, is considered to be an effective method to restore the configuration and function of breasts. Long-term follow-up visits are undergoing, especially the lymphoscintigraphy, 2 years after the operation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of ultrasonography as a follow-up tool for evaluating the effects of complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDPT) in breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL).METHODS: Twenty patients with BCRL were enrolled in this study. All patients had undergone therapy in the CDPT program for 2 weeks. Soft tissue thickness of both the affected and unaffected upper limb was measured before and after CDPT. The measurements were taken at 3 points (the mid-point between the medial and lateral epicondyles at the elbow level, 10 cm proximal and 10 cm distal to the elbow) with and without pressure. We then calculated the compliance of soft tissue before and after CDPT. Circumferences of both the affected and unaffected upper limb were also measured before and after CDPT at the 3 defined points.RESULTS: After 2 weeks of the CDPT program, the circumference and soft tissue thickness of the unaffected upper limb did not significantly change. In the affected upper limb, the circumference was significantly reduced in the 3 point, when compared with measurements taken prior to treatment. Additionally, soft tissue thickness was significantly reduced at the elbow and 10 cm proximal to the elbow. After CDPT, compliance at each of the 3 points had increased, but this trend was not significantly different.CONCLUSION: Our results showed that arm circumference and ultrasonography-derived soft tissue thickness was useful as a way of assessing therapeutic effects of CDPT.
Background: Lymphoedema developing in the breast and truncal area after treatment for breast cancer can be challenging to manage and distressing for patients. Kinesiology tape has traditionally been used in sports injuries and is considered effective at improving lymph drainage (Kase et al, 2003). It offers potential as a self-care option for managing swelling in this area. Aims: To explore women's feelings and experiences of using kinesiology tape in the breast and truncal area and to establish whether measurable change could be detected with its use. Methods: Kinesiology tape was applied weekly to the breast or chest wall for a period of three weeks, and circumference measurements of the chest wall using a standard narrow spring loaded tape measure were recorded weekly. The patients' experiences of using the tape was recorded on a simple questionnaire. Results: Ten patients completed the audit. Changes in measurement were difficult to establish but improvements in tissue texture were noted. The completed questionnaires indicated that the tape was comfortable but there were some concerns regarding ability to complete daily hygiene with the tape in place. The need for written information about the tape was highlighted. Conclusions: Kinesiology tape offers an additional approach to the management of lymphoedema, particularly in more challenging areas of the body, but decisions regarding its appropriateness for an individual should always be made following an assessment by a healthcare professional.
BACKGROUND: In secondary extremity lymphedema, normal antegrade lymphatic flow is disrupted by the disease state. Attempts to capture aberrant retrograde lymphatic flow by means of microsurgical lymphaticovenous anastomoses have been hindered because of technical limitations. The authors applied the intravascular stenting method to the surgical correction of extremity lymphedema to generate multiconfiguration lymphaticovenous anastomoses capable of decompressing both proximal and distal lymphatic flow.METHODS: Lymphatic channels were detected using indocyanine green injection and infrared scope imaging. Sites felt to be adequate for lymphaticovenous anastomosis were accessed through 2-cm skin incisions under local anesthesia. Using the intravascular stenting method, the authors performed a total of 39 lymphaticovenous anastomoses (15 flow-through, 11 end-to-end, eight end-to-side, two double end-to-end, two end-to-end/end-to-side, and one pi-type) on both the proximal and distal ends of lymphatic channels in 14 female patients with upper (n = 2) and lower (n = 12) extremity lymphedema.RESULTS: At an average follow-up of 8.9 months, average limb girth decreased 3.6 cm (range, 1.5 to 7 cm) or 11.3 percent (range, 4 to 33 percent). There was a greater reduction in cross-sectional area with increasing number of lymphaticovenous anastomoses per limb.CONCLUSIONS: The intravascular stenting method facilitated multiconfiguration lymphaticovenous anastomoses capable of decompressing both antegrade and retrograde lymphatic flow. This approach resulted in durable reduction of both upper and lower extremity lymphedema. As multiconfiguration lymphaticovenous anastomoses are now technically feasible, the influence of the number of lymphaticovenous anastomoses and the effectiveness of specific lymphaticovenous anastomosis configurations for the treatment of lymphedema deserves further study.
AIM: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the reduction in the volume of the upper limbs with lymphedema after exercises using the apparatus-assisted program associated with contention mechanism.PATIENTS AND METHOD: Twenty-eight female patients were selected and referred for evaluation and treatment of lymphedema after breast cancer therapy. The ages of the women ranged from 42 to 72 years with a mean age of 57 years. Inclusion criteria were treatment of cancer associated to a difference of at least 200 mL between the edematous and the contralateral limbs. Patients with active infections, skin lesions, and active disease were not included in the study. Four series of exercises using devices based on pedals, pulleys, a horizontal reflexion bar, and an elevation bar were selected. The participants were advised about the form of exercise: 15 minutes for each device, low intensity (less than 10 movements per minute), in the seated position, and the use of contention. Water displacement volumetry was performed before and after the 60-minute exercise session. The paired t-test was utilized with an alpha error of 5% considered acceptable (P value < 0.05).RESULTS: The mean difference between the volumetric measures before and after exercise was significant, with all the participants having reductions in the volume of the limbs using the four selected devices over time and at an intensity determined by this study.CONCLUSION: Association of a Godoy and Godoy contention during apparatus-assisted exercise reduced the edema in patients with lymphedema of the upper limbs.
PURPOSE: To evaluate an educational and exercise program for the prevention and progression of post-mastectomy lymphedema of the arm and shoulder.METHODS: Fifty-five patients who had undergone mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection between June 2009 and January 2010 were included in this study. The patients were informed by a trainer nurse about the precautions they should take to prevent the development of lymphedema. The patients were also trained for the appropriate exercises and were given written educational material prepared by the investigators.RESULTS: Among the participants, 96.4% underwent modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and 3.6% breast-conserving (BCS) surgery. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 9.87 +/- 17.55 months. The degree of lymphedema was found lower, even within 6 months, in the patients that exercised as compared to the patients that did not (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the risk of development and progression of mastectomy-related lymphedema was reduced with education and exercise provided by trained nurses at an early stage.
Introduction: In this study, the aim was to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on quality of life in postmastectomy lymphedema (PML) patients. Method(s): Twenty-four female patients diagnosed with PML were included in the study. Demographic features, disease and lymphedema duration, cancer type, cancer stage, operation type, radiotherapy and chemotherapy history, lymphedematous and dominant extremity, and body mass index (BMI) were recorded. LLLT was applied to the affected limb as 904 nm, 1.5 Joule/cm2, three days a week for a total of 8 weeks. Quality of life assessment, lymphedema severity, and lymphedema staging was performed to measure effectiveness before and after treatment. Patients with lymphedema not associated with breast cancer and/or primary lymphedema, ongoing radiotherapy, metastatic high-grade breast cancer, acute infection, and deep vein thrombosis were excluded from the study. Result(s): Modified radical mastectomy was reported in 18 patients; total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were reported in 6 patients. Of the patients, 45.8% were stage 3, and 54.2% were stage 2. Of the patients, 95.8% had a history of chemotherapy and 83% of radiotherapy after surgery. In this study, following LLLT, improvement of lymphedema stage and severity were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). In the evaluation of lymphedema quality of life, there was a statistically significant improvement in parameters including function, appearance, clinical symptoms, and overall quality of life (p < 0.05). However, no improvement was observed in the emotional state parameter (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Thus, LLLT is a safe treatment method that increases the quality of life in breast cancer-related lymphedema patients. Copyright © 2020 Biomedpress.
The use of compression garments during exercise is recommended for women with breast cancer-related lymphedema, but the evidence behind this clinical recommendation is unclear. The aim of this randomized, cross-over trial was to compare the acute effects of wearing versus not wearing compression during a single bout of moderate-load resistance exercise on lymphedema status and its associated symptoms in women with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). Twenty-five women with clinically diagnosed, stable unilateral breast cancer-related lymphedema completed two resistance exercise sessions, one with compression and one without, in a randomized order separated by a minimum 6 day wash-out period. The resistance exercise session consisted of six upper-body exercises, with each exercise performed for three sets at a moderate-load (10-12 repetition maximum). Primary outcome was lymphedema, assessed using bioimpedance spectroscopy (L-Dex score). Secondary outcomes were lymphedema as assessed by arm circumferences (percent inter-limb difference and sum-of-circumferences), and symptom severity for pain, heaviness and tightness, measured using visual analogue scales. Measurements were taken pre-, immediately post- and 24 hours post-exercise. There was no difference in lymphedema status (i.e., L-Dex scores) pre- and post-exercise sessions or between the compression and non-compression condition [Mean (SD) for compression pre-, immediately post- and 24 hours post-exercise: 17.7 (21.5), 12.7 (16.2) and 14.1 (16.7), respectively; no compression: 15.3 (18.3), 15.3 (17.8), and 13.4 (16.1), respectively]. Circumference values and symptom severity were stable across time and treatment condition. An acute bout of moderate-load, upper-body resistance exercise performed in the absence of compression does not exacerbate lymphedema in women with BCRL.
BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to examine the effects of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in the treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema using a compactly designed treatment regime consisting of eight therapy sessions in combination with a cluster laser device covering a total area size of 78.54 cm2 over the axillary.METHODS: Forty patients with unilateral lymphedema were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in order to evaluate effects of PBMT on lymphedema-related pain, quality of life, grip strength and limb volume difference. Subjects received irradiation for ten minutes per session using a cluster laser covering a beam area of 78.54 cm2. The applied energy was 384 Joules resulting in an energy density of 4.89 J/cm2.RESULTS: Post-treatment, a 50% reduction in median pain scores and an increase in mean quality of life were observed. Mean grip strength was persistently higher after eight sessions of PBMT compared with pretreatment; however, no statistically significant intergroup differences (P > 0.05) were found over the time course.CONCLUSION: PBMT using a compactly designed treatment regime in combination with a cluster laser device did not significantly improve quality of life, pain scores, grip strength and limb volume over the time course.
BACKGROUND AIMS. Lymphedema is a common complication with breast cancer treatment that does not have a definite cure. Our objective was to determine the efficacy of autologous stem cells (ASC) in the treatment of lymphedema secondary to mastectomy and axillary lymphadenectomy in comparison with traditional decongestive treatment with compression sleeves. METHODS. A prospective study including 20 women with lymphedema secondary to breast cancer surgery with axillary lymphadenectomy was conducted. Women were assigned at random to one of two groups. One group of 10 women was injected with ASC in the affected arm, whereas the other 10 women comprised the control group and received traditional compression sleeve therapy (CST). The follow-up for both groups was 12 weeks. Pain, sensitivity and mobility were assessed before and after therapy. RESULTS . There was improvement in the volume of lymphedema in both groups, with no significant difference. In the ASC group there was an overall volume reduction during the follow-up, whereas in the CST group lymphedema recurred after the compression sleeve was removed. CONCLUSIONS . Our findings suggest that ASC injection for patients with lymphedema can be an effective treatment. It reduces arm volume and associated co-morbidities of pain and decreased sensitivity. Traditional CST was also effective for lymphedema reduction, but it was dependent on continuous use of the treatment.
Less than 1% of all breast cancers occur in men, and although the disease is rare, the incidence appears to be increasing. This article reviews diagnosis, staging and treatment of the disease.
Globalization allows patients, including those with a life-limiting disease, such as cancer, to seek medical advice and second opinions beyond their own countries' borders, in search for available curative treatments. The increased travel opportunities and a broader access to communication technologies foster patients' mobility, even in a palliative care setting. Our patient travelled all the way to Europe from Mongolia to seek a second opinion on available treatments for her relapsing end-stage cervical cancer. Best supportive care, as proposed by the Mongolian colleagues was confirmed after a chemotherapeutic trial, leading to the patient's request for a rapid repatriation. The purpose of the following case report is to identify the various factors which may facilitate the care of patients with end-stage disease travelling from foreign countries and to highlight the complexity of a repatriation process for palliative care recipients.

Central nervous system (CNS) metastasis carries a significant morbidity and mortality in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are highly CNS-penetrant and have demonstrated remarkable intracranial activity across clinical studies, and yet radiation remains the mainstay of treatment modality against CNS metastasis. We have previously reported alectinib can induce CNS radiation necrosis even after a remote history of radiation (7 years post-radiation). Lorlatinib is another potent next-generation ALK TKI that can overcome many ALK resistance mutations and has been shown to have excellent activity in patients with baseline CNS metastasis. Here we report two ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients who developed radiation necrosis shortly after initiating lorlatinib following progression on the sequential treatment of crizotinib, alectinib, and brigatinib. In both cases, radiation necrosis is evidenced by serial MRI images and histological examination of the resected CNS metastasis that had previously been radiated. Our cases highlight the importance of recognizing CNS radiation necrosis that may mimic disease progression in ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with and potentially precipated by next-generation ALK TKIs. © 2020 Zhu et al.
Background: Patients with B cell malignancies refractory to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) can be treated by subsequent immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). But unlike myeloid leukemia, B cell leukemia and lymphoma are less sensitive to allogeneic adoptive immunotherapy. Moreover, the beneficial graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effect may be associated with moderate to severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, novel therapeutic approaches augmenting the anti-tumor efficacy of DLI and dissociating the GVL effect from GVHD are needed. The anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 trifunctional bispecific antibody (trAb) FBTA05 may improve the targeting of tumor cells by redirecting immune allogeneic effector cells while reducing the risk of undesirable reactivity against normal host cells. Hence, FBTA05 may maximize GVL effects by simultaneously decreasing the incidence and severity of GVHD.Methods/Design: Based on this underlying treatment concept and on promising data taken from preclinical results and a small pilot study, an open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, dose-escalating phase I/II-study is conducted to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of the investigational antibody FBTA05 in combination with DLI for patients suffering from rituximab- and/or alemtuzumab-refractory, CD20-positive low- or high-grade lymphoma after allogeneic SCT. During the first trial phase with emphasis on dose escalation a maximum of 24 patients distributed into 4 cohorts will be enrolled. For the evaluation of preliminary efficacy data a maximum of 12 patients (6 patients with low-grade lymphoma and/or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) / 6 patients with high-grade or aggressive lymphoma) will attend the second phase of this clinical trial.Discussion: Promising data (e.g. induction of cellular immunity; GVL predominance over GVHD; achievement of partial or complete responses; prolongation of time-to-progression) obtained from this phase I/II trial would represent the first milestone in the clinical evaluation of a novel immunotherapeutic concept for treatment-resistant low- and high-grade lymphoma and NHL patients in relapse.Trial registration: NCT01138579. © 2013 Buhmann et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare form of malignancy, accounting for 2% of all cancers of the head and neck in Europe. Axillary lymph node metastases are very rare in these cases. This is a case report of a 40-year-old premenopausal woman diagnosed in May 2015 with T1N2M0 stage III NPC, treated with induction chemotherapy, followed by chemo-radiotherapy. Post-therapeutic computed tomography (CT) scan showed partial response (PR) on the primary tumor and complete response (CR) on the latero-cervical lymph nodes. In 2017, our patient developed left carcinomatous-like mastitis with axillary lymphadenopathy. This raised suspicions of a carcinomatous mastitis. The pathology report with immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the third biopsy highlighted axillary metastasis of a non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (NSCC). There are very few references in the literature regarding axillary metastases from squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). As far as we know, this is the first case report of mastitis due to NPC. To conclude, treatment consisted of two surgical excisions of axillary lymphadenopathy associated with local radiotherapy and chemotherapy (neo-adjuvant, adjuvant). The second surgery, performed after radiotherapy, required plastic surgery. A psychiatric evaluation was necessary, revealing a reactive anxiety disorder. This case required multidisciplinary management, where oncology, plastic surgery, pathology and psychiatric specialists collaborated in deciding the therapeutic approach.Copyright © 2021 Spandidos Publications.

Background: We report a case of a patient with appendicular bone involvement of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma visualized by whole-body technetium-99m methylenediphosphonate bone scintigraphy (bone scan) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Case presentation: A 73-year-old Asian man who had gingival swelling of the labial area of the left maxillary lateral incisor presented to our institution. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography demonstrated hypermetabolic lesions with maximum standardized uptake values of 12.15 in the left testis, 1.92 in the skin of the right chest, and 2.88 in the left ulna and third metatarsal bone. A bone scan showed multiple uptakes in the left ulna, hand, both tibiae, and the left foot. We diagnosed the tumor as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by excision. Magnetic resonance imaging showed enhanced signaling of lesions with soft tissue edema in the olecranon of the left ulna, the third metacarpal bone of the left hand, and the third metatarsal bone of the left foot. Magnetic resonance imaging findings prompted a diagnosis of lymphoma. Eight cycles of chemotherapy plus external radiotherapy targeted to the involved bone sites were given for 5 months. Follow-up positron emission tomography/computed tomography and bone scanning revealed the disappearance of hypermetabolism and decreased uptake in lesions compared with the previous images. Laboratory data were also all within the normal limits after chemotherapy. Conclusions: This report highlights that appendicular bone involvement of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma can be detected on whole-body bone scans and by positron emission tomography/computed tomography. © 2017 The Author(s).
Subcutaneous Panniculitis like T cell Lymphoma (SPTCL) is an uncommon variant and poorly differentiated type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Here we describe the case of a 19-year-old female who presented with swelling of left half of the face with no regional lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly which was initially misdiagnosed as a benign cutaneous condition by various practitioners. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse infiltration of subcutaneous plane by small to medium sized atypical lymphocytes. Immunohistochemistry showed CD3, CD8 and betaF-1 positivity; CD20, CD56, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and TCR-delta negativity. Clinical profile, histopathology and immunohistochemical analysis yielded a diagnosis of SPTCL. Thus cases with atypical and nonresolving dermatological lesions should raise a suspicion of SPTCL as diagnosis against other benign conditions.Copyright © 2016, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Introduction and importance: Bouveret syndrome is a rare condition characterised by gastric outlet obstruction secondary to a gallstone fistulating into the proximal duodenum or pylorus. Although rare, this condition carries a high mortality rate and no current standardised guidelines for management. Case presentation: We present a case of a patient in their 60s with recurrent small bowel obstruction secondary to a cholecysto-duodenal fistula and large gallstone which became impacted in the fourth part of the duodenum. The patient had a P-POSSUM Score of 14% mortality and 60% morbidity risk, had multiple co-morbidities, was bedbound, BMI 59 and had been deemed high risk for general anaesthetic at oncology centre for a 10 x 10 cm likely gynaecological malignancy a month prior to this admission. Clinical discussion: In contrast to existing literature, endoscopic lithotripsy was considered but not attempted due to unavailability of this service locally. Surgical intervention was decided based on radiological features of impending duodenal perforation on CT imaging and multiple disciplinary team discussion. The patient was managed with open enterolithotomy at the duodeno-jejunal (DJ) flexure and discharged 3 weeks post-operatively at her pre-operative baseline. Conclusion(s): This is the first report to our knowledge to describe successful surgical management of a gallstone impacted in the fourth part of the duodenum. In cases where anatomical location of impaction precludes retrieval via simple gastrostomy, we suggest using high pressure flush to mobilise the stone to more favourable location distally. We emphasise that stone size should be considered when planning surgical management.Copyright © 2022 The Authors
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Yellow nail syndrome is a rare disorder involving characteristic nail changes, lymphedema and chronic respiratory symptoms. Currently there is no definitive treatment and there have been no prospective randomised controlled trials evaluating the available options. In order to strengthen the literature on this topic, we present the case of a 67-year-old man with YNS and a detailed review of current treatment options.METHODS: We included 40 articles for the final review according to their relevance with the subject.RESULTS: Data for use of the commonly chosen therapies for YNS remains inconclusive, with small studies and case reports showing mixed results of efficacy.CONCLUSION: Although the date indicates that it is reasonable to recommend a trial of conservative therapy including vitamin E, antibiotics and compression stockings before pursuing more aggressive or invasive modalities, larger scale studies are required to determine the true efficacy of all treatment options.
OBJECTIVE: Our study examines the financial cost of lymphedema following a diagnosis of breast cancer and addresses a significant knowledge gap regarding the additional impact of lymphedema on breast cancer survivors.METHODS: An online national survey was conducted with 361 women who had either breast cancer without lymphedema (BC) (group 1, n = 209) or breast cancer with lymphedema (BC+LE) (group 2, n = 152). Participant recruitment was supported by the Breast Cancer Network Australia and the Australasian Lymphology Association.RESULTS: Both breast cancer and lymphedema result in significant out-of-pocket financial costs borne by women. Of patients with BC+LE, 80% indicated that their breast cancer diagnosis had affected them financially compared with 67% in the BC group (P < .020). For patients with lymphedema, over half (56%) indicated that this specific additional diagnosis to their breast cancer affected them financially and that costs increased with lymphedema severity. The cost of compression garments formed a large proportion of these costs (40.1%). The average number of attendances to a therapist each year was 5.8 (range, 0-45). Twenty-five patients (16.4%) had an episode of cellulitis in the past year. The incidence of cellulitis was 7.7% in 91 patients with subclinical or mild lymphedema compared with 29.5% of 61 patients with more extensive lymphedema (P < .001). The average out-of-pocket financial cost of lymphedema care borne by women was A$977 per annum, ranging from A$207 for subclinical lymphedema to over A$1400 for moderate or severe lymphedema.CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies an additional detrimental effect of lymphedema on women in terms of financial costs.

INTRODUCTION: Metastatic prostate cancer is a relatively common condition in elderly men. The aim of this paper is to report a rare case of metastatic prostate cancer presenting as a large pelvic mass mimicking lymphoma and to discuss its management.PRESENTATION OF CASE: An 85-year-old patient was complaining of lower urinary tract symptoms, and significant pelvic swelling. On physical examination, a 15-cm pelvic mass and lumpy prostate were found. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated PSA levels (PSA=300g/mL). CT scan showed a large lobulated necrotic pelvic mass and multiple swollen lymphnodes. The diagnosis of an atypical pelvic lymphoma associated with a metastatic prostate cancer was first evoked. An ultrasonography-guided biopsy of the mass was carried. The immunohistochemical study confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma. A bilateral orchiectomy was performed. A follow up of 3 months showed a decrease of PSA without shrinkage of the mass.DISCUSSION: A metastatic prostate cancer presenting as a compressive pelvic mass mimicking other diagnosis such as lymphomas, is a rare circumstance of discovery. In our case, atypical pelvic lymphoma was evoked based on the association of multiple retroperitoneal enlarged lymphnodes. Histological findings of the biopsy rectified the diagnosis and confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma. The main treatment for such metastatic prostate cancers remains hormone therapy. Some authors reported external beam radiotherapy in order to reduce prostate volume.CONCLUSION: Prostate cancer should be considered in the assessment of large pelvic masses. Digital rectal examination and testing PSA levels can lead to the diagnosis. After histological confirmation, the androgen deprivation is the main treatment.
Introduction: The diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is defined in terms of its microscopic appearance (histology) and the expression of cell surface markers (immunophenotype). Aims and objectives: This study aims to analyze the clinical features, histomorphology, and immunoprofile of over 200 patients of HL diagnosed over a period of 4 years at our institute and to determine relative frequency of various histological subtypes (based on WHO classification) in relation to age and sex distribution in this part of the country. Materials and Methods: All HL cases diagnosed between January 2006 and December 2009 were retrieved from hospital records. The histopathology of both lymph node and bone marrow biopsy (where ever available) along with immunohistochemistry (CD15, CD30, CD20, and ALK) were reviewed. Results: There was a bimodal age distribution. HL affected people a decade earlier than in the western population. The most common presenting complaint was cervical lymphadenopathy. Mixed cellularity was the most frequent subtype (67%), followed by nodular sclerosing subtype (23.5%). Group A (CD15+, CD30+, CD20-), which represents the archetypical immunophenotype of classical HL (CHL) was the most common type (60.6%). The number of CD15 negative CHL was 35.8% and CD20 positive CHL was 17.5%. CD15 negativity with CD20 positivity was seen in 5% CHL. One out of seven CD20 positive CHL patients showed relapse. Conclusion: In this paper, we have discussed in detail about various clinical and histopathological parameters of HL and their relative frequency in various histological subtypes. This paper is being presented as it is a rather large study from India taking into consideration the clinical, pathologic, and immunophenotypic profile of the patients. © 2016 Indian Journal of Medical and Paediatric Oncology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.
A brain abscess is uncommon but potentially lethal. Common predisposing risk factors include congenital cyanotic heart disease, immunocompromised status, and the presence of septic foci. We describe a left frontal brain abscess accompanied by fever, headache, and weight loss for a 3-month period. The presumptive source of the brain abscess involved a left peritonsillar abscess. To the best of our knowledge, one similar case was reported in the literature in 1929. The specific signs of peritonsillar abscess in our patient included trismus, decreased phonation, and a muffled voice. The peritonsillar abscess was not clinically diagnosed, but incidentally detected on lower axial sections of cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Fever and trismus improved after surgical drainage of the peritonsillar abscess. The cerebral abscess was conservatively treated with intravenous antibiotics. The patient developed hydrocephalus as a sequela to the involvement of the basal meninges. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
BACKGROUND: Supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenular anastomosis is becoming a useful treatment option for progressive lower extremity lymphedema because of its minimal invasiveness. Finding a lymphatic vessel is a minimum requirement for lymphaticovenular anastomosis surgery, but no study has reported comprehensive analysis on factors associated with lymphatic vessel detection.METHODS: One hundred thirty-four female secondary lower extremity lymphedema patients who underwent indocyanine green lymphography and lymphaticovenular anastomosis without a history of lymphedema surgery were included. Medical charts were reviewed to obtain clinical, indocyanine green lymphographic, and intraoperative findings. Lymphatic vessel detection was defined as positive when one or more lymphatic vessels were found in a surgical field of lymphaticovenular anastomosis. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with lymphatic vessel detection.RESULTS: Patient age ranged from 36 to 81 years, duration of edema ranged from 3 to 324 months, and body mass index ranged from 16.2 to 33.3 kg/m. Forty-eight patients (35.8 percent) had a history of radiation therapy, and 76 patients (56.7 percent) had a history of cellulitis. Lymphaticovenular anastomoses were performed in 840 surgical fields, among which lymphatic vessel detection was positive in 807 fields; the overall lymphatic vessel detection rate was 96.1 percent. Multivariate analysis revealed inverse associations in higher body mass index (OR, 0.323; p = 0.008) and the S-region/D-region on indocyanine green lymphography compared with the L-region (OR, 1.049 x 10(-8)/1.724 x 10(-9); p < 0.001/p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Independent factors associated with lymphatic vessel detection were clarified. Lower body mass index and L-region on indocyanine green lymphography are favorable conditions for finding lymphatic vessels in lower extremity lymphedema patients.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Risk, III.
BACKGROUND: Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) had extended responses to the androgen receptor antagonist ODM-201, in phase 1/2 studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and antitumour activity of prolonged ODM-201 treatment in patients with CRPC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The ARADES trial was a multicentre phase 1 (dose escalation) and phase 2 (dose expansion) trial; 134 patients with CRPC were stratified by previous chemotherapy to receive ODM-201. This paper reports extended follow-up in CYP17 inhibitor (CYP17i)-naive patients. INTERVENTION: Patients (n=77) received oral ODM-201 twice daily at daily doses of 200-1800mg. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Safety, measured as the occurrence of adverse events (AEs), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and radiographic progression. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The safety profile of extended ODM-201 treatment (median treatment duration 8.2 mo, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6-11.0) was consistent with that reported at the time of the original data cutoff in the main ARADES trial, with no unexpected safety concerns over time. The majority of AEs (61.1%) were mild (grade 1); the most common AE was fatigue/asthenia (35.1% of patients), with no clear relationship to ODM-201. Median time to PSA progression was 25.2 mo (95% CI 11.3-25.2) for chemotherapy-naive men and not reached (NR; 95% CI 5.5-NR) for chemotherapy-pretreated patients; a trend for improved antitumour response was observed for chemotherapy-naive patients. The median time to radiographic progression was longer for chemotherapy-naive (14.0 mo, 95% CI 8.1-33.3) than for chemotherapy-pretreated (7.2 mo, 95% CI 2.7-11.0) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged exposure to ODM-201 was well tolerated, with no additional safety concerns; disease suppression was sustained, especially in chemotherapy-naive patients. These data support further development of ODM-201 in men with CYP17i-naive CRPC. PATIENT SUMMARY: Extended ODM-201 therapy was well tolerated, with beneficial antitumour activity in men with advanced prostate cancer, indicating that ODM-201 may represent a new active treatment for men with CRPC. This extension trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) under identification number NCT01429064.
BACKGROUND: Indocyanine green lymphography has been a highly useful modality in the clinical examination and surgical management of patients with lymphedema. No formal classification system of indocyanine green imaging findings according to the severity of lymphedema exists, however. The purpose of this study was to describe, analyze, and classify characteristic indocyanine green lymphography findings to uniformly guide surgical management of lymphedema using this modality.METHODS: Forty-five patients (78 limbs) with lower extremity lymphedema underwent indocyanine green lymphography. All lymphography images were recorded in photographs and videos. Images were reviewed and analyzed to classify characteristic findings according to clinical severity as determined by Campisi clinical lymphedema staging.RESULTS: Lymphography findings were classifiable into two patterns. Mild cases of lymphedema were characterized by a linear lymphatic channel pattern (linear pattern). In more severe cases, lymphatic channels demonstrated retrograde lymphatic flow (dermal backflow pattern) and diminution or absence of linear channel patterning. Three dermal backflow patterns, splash, stardust, and diffuse, were identified and correlated with the progression of lymphedema severity. These findings supported the generation of a novel anatomical lymphedema severity staging system, the dermal backflow staging system.CONCLUSIONS: Indocyanine green lymphography is a safe, minimally invasive, and useful tool for the surgical evaluation of extremity lymphedema. Characteristic indocyanine green lymphography patterns are consistent and correlate with clinical severity. The dermal backflow staging system can facilitate patient stratification, discussion between referring parties, and surgical planning.
The presenting symptoms of sinonasal lymphoma are usually similar to those of benign inflammatory diseases. Adequate amount of biopsy tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis because tumor coexisting with necrosis or inflammation is not uncommon. Therefore, the diagnosis of sinonasal lymphoma is a challenge for rhinologists. Thirty-two patients diagnosed as having sinonasal lymphoma from 1990 to 2010 in our hospital were included in this study. The presenting symptoms of these patients included nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, bloody discharge/epistaxis, post nasal drip, facial swelling, neck mass, orbital symptoms, fever, and body weight loss. The average period between patients' awareness of their symptoms and their decision to seek medical help was 8.9 months. When they were referred to our hospital, the first impression of 20 patients (62.5%) was benign or malignant nasal neoplasm, and that of the other 12 patients (37.5%) was rhinitis or rhinosinusitis. These patients then received image studies and biopsy or surgical intervention. Most patients needed repeated biopsies, endoscopic sinus surgery, turbinectomy, or Caldwell-Luc operation for a definitive diagnosis. Their histopathologic classification included NK/T cell lymphoma (n - 13, 40.6%), peripheral T cell lymphoma (n - 12, 37.5%), and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n - 7, 21.9%). Peripheral T cell lymphoma and NK/T cell lymphoma mostly occurred in the nasal cavity, whereas sinus involvement without nasal disease is common in B-cell lymphoma Our results reveal that patients with sinonasal NHL tend to ignore their symptoms until they become serious, and a definitive diagnosis usually requires repeat and deep biopsy. © Springer-Verlag 2011.
BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that mapping the lymphatic drainage of the arm with blue dye (axillary reverse mapping [ARM]) during axillary lymphadenectomy decreases the likelihood of disruption of lymphatics and subsequent lymphedema.METHODS: This institutional review board-approved study involved 360 patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and/or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) from May 2006 to October 2011. Technetium sulfur colloid (4 mL) was injected subareolarly, and 5 mL of blue dye was injected subcutaneously in the volar surface ipsilateral upper extremity (ARM). Data were collected on variations in lymphatic drainage, successful identification and protection of arm lymphatics, crossover, and occurrence of lymphedema.RESULTS: A group of 360 patients underwent SLNB and/or ALND, 348 of whom underwent a SLNB. Of those, 237 (68.1%) had a SLNB only, and 111 (31.9%) went on to an ALND owing to a positive axilla. An additional 12 of 360 (3.3%) axilla had ALND owing to a clinically positive axilla/preoperative core needle biopsy. In 96% of patients with SLNB (334/348), breast SLNs were hot but not blue; crossover (SLN hot and blue) was seen in 14 of 348 patients (4%). Blue lymphatics were identified in 80 of 237 SLN incisions (33.7%) and in 93 of 123 ALND (75.4%). Average follow-up was 12 months (range, 3-48) and resulted in a SLNB lymphedema rate of 1.7% (4/237) and ALND of 2.4% (3/123).CONCLUSION: ARM identified substantial lymphatic variations draining the upper extremities and facilitated preservation. Metastases in ARM-identified lymph nodes were acceptably low, indicating that ARM is safe. ARM added to present-day ALND and SLNB may be useful to lesser rates of lymphedema.
Background: Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema of the arm (BCRL), a debilitating complication after axillary lymph node dissection and irradiation, is caused by the accumulation of interstitial fluid of the affected arm due to a blockage or a malfunction of the lymphatic system. The incidence of BCRL varies between 6% and 62.5% due to various measurement methods and diagnostic criteria and different patient and treatment risk factors.(1) A prospective analysis of the incidence of BCRL in 52 early breast cancer (BC) patients receiving radiotherapy concomitant with adjuvant anthracyclines and paclitaxel has been done and compared with the incidence in a control group, consisting of 48 patients receiving concurrent irradiation and anthracyclines only. Method(s): All patients have been treated with breast surgery and axillary lymph node dissection followed by concurrent postoperative irradiation (50 Gy on the chest wall and regional lymph nodes) and chemotherapy, consisting of 4&z.ast;FEC (500/75/600 mg/m2) followed by 12&z.ast;weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) or 6 cycles of FEC only. The circumferences of both arms have been measured by tape every three weeks during the adjuvant chemotherapy, every three months during the first year and every 6 months during the second year postoperatively. A difference of >= 2 cm in limb girth between the two arms has been considered as the clinical diagnosis of BCRL. Result(s): Fifty two patients were enrolled prospectively in the paclitaxel group. At 1 to 2 years post diagnosis, there was a BCRL incidence of 40% in the paclitaxel group. In most of the patients the BCRL occurred early during the adjuvant therapy with paclitaxel, suggesting a possible causal relationship with the use of taxanes. The incidence measured retrospectively in the control group was 3 times lower. Conclusion(s): This is the first prospective analysis of the incidence of BCRL in early BC pts treated with concomitant post operative irradiation and anthracyclines followed by taxanes comparing with a control group treated with concurrent irradiation and anthracyclines only. The early onset during adjuvant taxane treatment suggests that capillary leakage, together with the previous concomitant chemo-irradiation, is a potential mechanism that contributes to the occurrence of BCRL. In a second prospective study our research group is investigating whether and how the onset of BCRL during paclitaxel can be monitored, prevented or blunted.
